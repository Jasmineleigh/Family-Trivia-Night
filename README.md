# Family-Trivia-Night
This is a trivia game I created for fun.
I will continue to update this as I go.
I strictly made this to help me get comfortable with Python.
Although I may not have implemented this in the best way, it's a start.
---Overview---
->The game consists of 3 different rounds : Black History, Guess the song, Finish the Lyric, Random Trivia
->There has to be 6 players (until I figure out how to make that optional)
->Each player enters a nickname for the game
->Each player trys to guess the number closest to the number the computer picks (randomly generated)
->This determines the order of the players
->At the end of  each round, a leaderbaord will be displayed
